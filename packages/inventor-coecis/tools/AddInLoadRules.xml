        Only paths that require Administrator privileges to write to should be specified
        as "Allow" here. Any path can be blocked with a "Block" setting.                                                                                         
        The line below allows the 3Dconnexion (3D Mouse) add-in if it is installed to its 
        default location.

    <!-- Publisher rules                                                                 
       
        Trusted publishers should be added to the Operating System's Trusted Store if possible. 
        They can optionally be specified here. If they are in the Trusted Store, it is not
        necessary to have an entry here. Note that publishers can be either trusted or not
        trusted in the Trusted Store (and here).
     
        These examples show allowing and blocking fictitious publishers:
                                                                                      
            <Publisher Policy="Allow">ACME Software, Inc.</Publisher>
          
            <Publisher Policy="Block">Malware Unlimited, LLC.</Publisher>
    -->

 
  <!-- ID rules
       
        These rules refer to the add-in by its "ClientId" value (a GUID) in the .addin file
        that describes the add-in. Add-ins should only be blocked, not allowed, by an ID rule,
        since add-in GUIDs are easily discoverable and not checked for uniqueness. Thus a
        malicious add-in could copy the GUID from an add-in that has been allowed by ID and
        would be permitted to load. 
        This example shows blocking a known (fictitious) bad add-in:     
            <Id Policy="Block">{4CD437C3-1360-4A34-841F-F877DAF4969D}</Id>
   -->


  <!-- Fallback rule  
  
        This rule specifies what to do if no other rules apply to an add-in.
        The other rules include Inventor's internal rules (for add-ins supplied by Autodesk) and any
        rules appearing above this rule in this file.
 
        If the policy for this rule is "Block", any add-ins not covered by previous rules will be
        silently blocked. No dialog will be presented to the user. This is the most secure setting,
        and is the one that should be used by administrators wishing to prevent all loading of
        non-approved add-ins by end users.
 
        If the policy for this rule is "Allow", any add-ins not covered by previous rules will be
        silently allowed. No dialog will be presented to the user. This eliminates all checking
        for unknown add-ins, so it is the most insecure option and is not recommended.
 
        If there is no fallback rule (e.g. it is commented out), or the value of the rule is something
        other than "Allow" or "Block", the end user will be prompted the first time an add-in attempts
        to load. After the first time, the user's choice will be remembered.
