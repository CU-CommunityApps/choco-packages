This is the offical repo for:

```

J Blaber, B Adair, A Antoniou
Experimental Mechanics 55 (6), 1105-1122
```

and contains the must up-to-date version of this code.

This software performs 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC). Simply call it like:

`>> handles_ncorr = ncorr;`

in your Matlab terminal. MEX files associated with the program *should* compile automagically and GUI will appear. For more information, please visit the associated website at: [https://www.ncorr.com](https://www.ncorr.com)
