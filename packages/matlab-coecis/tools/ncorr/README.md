This is the precompiled ncorr addon for MATLAB. 

Liran Gazit from MAE compiled with MinGW and supplied these files. It is set up for single core only, he will need to supply a multi-core enabled version if they want that. Requires compilation with Visual Studio.

It's possible, but unlikely, that it will need to be recompiled for a new version of MATLAB. Regardless, Liran or someone else at MAE should be responsible for providing the compiled files.
