This is the precompiled ncorr addon for MATLAB. mingw 5.3.0 was used to compile the files here. 

mingw could be installed via choco and then the install_ncorr.m script could be run with matlab via postinstall.ps1 to compile at build time. This *might* be needed if a new version of MATLAB is used, i.e. maybe these only work with R2017a?
